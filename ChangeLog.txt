+ Handle of Stamina Bar 
  Based on Blonde collisions:
  - Increased when Blonde collides with Bullet AND is not Blond; 
  - Decreased when Blonde collides with Prof AND is Blond
  - Created static instance for StaminaManager and BiondeManager classes
+ Handling Blonde state (isBlonde isSmart)
  - Created static instance for BiondeManager class, changing value of isBlond based on collisions:
  - isBlond starts as false, it becomes true when collides with Bullet and false when with prof;
+ Handling Prof movements based on Blonde state
  - Created static instance for ProfManager, SpawnProf and StaminaManager classes
  - Based on isBlond value of BlondeManager and isActive value of ProfManager, if both are true the prof starts looking for closest bionda (FindClosestBionda).
  - Created DisableState and EnableState methods for handling scenario when we remove prof from the scene.
    When prof gets removed, isActive state gets false value. When prof reappears, isActive state gets true value.
